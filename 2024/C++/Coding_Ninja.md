Introduction 
C++ is a general-purpose programming language and is widely used nowadays for competitive programming. It has imperative, object-oriented, and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platforms like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac, etc. It can be used to develop operating systems, browsers, games, and so on. This makes C++ powerful as well as flexible.

For this course, you will be provided with the in-built compiler of Coding Ninjas. However, if you want to run programs and practice them on your local desktop, various compilers like Code blocks, VS Code, Dev C++, Atom, and many more exist. You may choose one for yourself

1) Simple: C++ is a simple language because it provides a structured approach (to break the problem into parts), a rich set of library functions, data types, etc. It allows us to follow both procedural as well as functional approach to design our flow of control.
2) Portability: It is the concept of carrying the instruction from one system to another system. In C++, Language .cpp file contains source code, and we can also edit this code. .exe file contains the application, which is the only file that can be executed. When we write and compile any C++ program on the Windows operating system, it efficiently runs on other window-based systems.
3) Powerful: C++ is a very powerful programming language, and it has a wide variety of data types, functions, control statements, decision-making statements, etc. C++ is a fast language as compilation and execution time is less. Also, it has a wide variety of data types, functions & operators.
4) Rich Library: C++ library is full of in-built functions that save a tremendous amount of time in the software development process. As it contains almost all kinds of functionality, a programmer can need in the development process. Hence, saving time and increasing development speed.
5) Platform Dependent: Platform dependent language means the language in which programs can be executed only on that operating system where it is developed & compiled. It cannot run or execute on any other operating system. E.g., compiled programs on Linux wonâ€™t run on Windows.
6) Mid-level programming language: C++ can do both low-level & high-level programming. That is the reason why C++ is known as a mid-level programming language.
7) Structured programming language: C++ is a structured programming language as it allows to break the program into parts using functions. So, it is easy to understand and modify.
8) Object-oriented: C++ is an object-oriented programming language. OOPs make development and maintenance easier, whereas, in Procedure-oriented programming language, it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size grows. It follows the concept of oops like polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction.
9) Case sensitive: C++ is a case-sensitive programming language. In C++ programming, 'break and BREAK' both are different.
10) Compiler Based: C++ is a compiler-based language, unlike Python. C++ programs used to be compiled, and their executable file is used to run it due to which C++ is a relatively faster language than Java and Python.
11) Syntax-based language: C++ is a strongly typed syntax-based programming language. If any language follows the rules and regulations strictly, it is known as a strongly syntax-based language.Other examples of syntax-based languages are C, C++, Java, .net etc.
12) Pointer: C++ supports pointers that allow the user to deal directly with the memory and control the programmer. This makes it very suitable for low-level tasks and very complicated projects. It is known to increase the speed of execution by decreasing the memory access overhead.
13) Dynamic Memory Management: It supports the feature of dynamic memory allocation. In C++ language, we can free the allocated memory by calling the free() function. These features are missing in languages like C.
